            When it comes to cyber threats, you canâ€™t always predict when one
            will occur, but you can prepare. Responding to a cyber incident is a
            business-wide responsibility. Your entire organization should be
            prepared to react with speed, agility, common purpose and the right
            security services.
          </p>
          <p className="my-6">
            The IBM X-Force Cyber Range solution creates immersive simulations
            to guide your team through realistic breach scenarios, helping
            ensure you can respond and recover from enterprise-level cyber
            security incidents, manage vulnerabilities, and build a stronger
            security culture in your organization.

            Since our launch in 2016, over 17,000 business leaders have gone
            through our immersive training, finding ideas of growth in their
